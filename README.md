# NuclearCraft Reactor Planning App

## About

This is an Angular application intended to assist with planning reactors for NuclearCraft (TODO: link), a mod bringing realistic(ish) nuclear physics to Minecraft.  Application is hosted on GitHub Pages [here](https://animusfracto.github.io/NC-reactor-app).


This is still in a bit of a proof-of-concept phase, and I expect aggressive refactoring will be in the future.  If I had to version this, it would be 0.2.0.
